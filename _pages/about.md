I am an Economics Bachelor with a keen interest in various academic fields, including economic development, income and education inequality, innovation, and technology. I enjoy delving into literature that explores the impact of advanced technologies on daily life and society. With this in mind, I am enthusiastic about enhancing my programming skills in Machine Learning and policy evaluation tools.

Selected Experience
======
Starting September 2023, I'll be pursuing a specialization in Data Science for Social Science and Public Management at PUCP. I'll be sharing my projects on GitHub as part of this journey.

In the 2022-1 term, I took the Machine Learning and Causal Inference course at PUCP. I learned to estimate causality using techniques like lasso regressions, causal trees, and causal forest. Check out the course materials here. This course also honed my programming skills in Python, R, and Julia.

My university projects and work have mostly involved using Stata, and I've handled several relevant databases such as Encuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO), Encuesta Económica Anual (EEA), Encuesta Nacional de Innovación (ENIIM) and Sistema de Información para la toma de Decisiones (SIRTOD).

Achivements and Publications
======
During my undergraduate career, my colleague Enrique and I secured the top position in the economics research category of the Social Science Faculty Contest. Our winning entry adopted a historical approach to analyze the impact of ideology on economic and social inequalities in Peru since its independence. You can read our work [here] (https://facultad.pucp.edu.pe/ciencias-sociales/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/estudioeconomico-enrique-rios-alvaro-zapata.pdf).

My first publication was on the indexed anthropology students journal: [Anthropía](https://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/anthropia). I had the chance to publish a book review. You can read it [here](https://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/anthropia/article/view/22267).

Web Articles
======
From 2021 to 2022, I served as a member and former Sub-Director of the Research and Publication department at the Economics Students Journal: [Económica](https://economica.pe/). In addition to my responsibilities of organizing meetings and establishing team objectives, I had the privilege of contributing web articles that delved into topics such as income inequality and fiscal policy in Peru and the USA. You can read the articles [here](https://economica.pe/?s=alvaro+zapata).

Nice to meet you !
