title: [PROINNOVATE Peru](https://github.com/AlvaroZapata27/pro_innovateperu)
excerpt: "On this occasion, I was interested in analyzing the current and finished Financed Projects  of PROINNOVATE - [National Program for Technological Development and Innovation - PROINNOVATE]. These bases contain extensive information on 6,107 projects from 2007 to 2023.
I wanted to answer the questions about what types of projects and technologies the institution supports through financial and non-financial resources. To do this, I programed a code that allows  to classify the projects based on the textual analysis of their descriptions. This classification assigns a score according to the incidence of KeyWords in the descriptions and identifies a main and a secondary category. <br/><img src='/images/tend.jpg'>"
